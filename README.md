# Hey there, I'm Tim! 👋

I’m a developer based in Copenhagen, currently studying at **Copenhagen City School**. I mostly code in **Python** and **Go**, but I’m always looking to go deeper into hardware.

### 🚀 My North Star
My ultimate goal is to build an **original OS kernel from scratch**. To make that happen, I’m currently diving into **C** and **Assembly** to understand the bridge between software and hardware.
